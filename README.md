- **Note**: Ensure the main database is current before running this step.

### 3. Neurotech Status Verification
- **Task**: Review the *not evaluated* file to classify each company as neurotech or non-neurotech.
- **Action**: Fill in missing info (e.g., sector, website) through online research.

### 4. Logo and URL Collection
- **Task**: Add company logos to the shared folder and use the GUI to update URLs in the database.

### 5. Finder Website Update
- **Task**: Upload the updated database to the [Finder website](https://www.brainstormil.com/neuro-finder).

### 6. Annual Report

## üìù Usage
1. **Acquire Data**: Download CSV files (Crunchbase, Startup Nation Central) using relevant keywords.

### CrunchBase:

- **Edit the filter:**  
  - **Headquarters Location:** Israel  
  - **Description Keywords:** `['brain', 'mental health', 'psychology', 'neurotech', 'cognitive', 'neuroscience', 'cognition', 'neuro', 'bci', 'neuroimaging', 'synapse']`

- **‚ö†Ô∏èNote:‚ö†Ô∏è** As of **August 2024**, you'll need to download the CSV file for each keyword separately. Additionally, each page must be downloaded individually for example:
    ```bash
    files_names = ['cognition1.csv', 'cognition2.csv', 'cognition3.csv']
    ```
